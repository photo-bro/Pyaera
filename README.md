Pyaera
=====
Python and Pygame implementation of Aera
----------------------------------------

###Course:
CSCI 220 Programming Languages  
Professor John Broere  
Principia College  

###Team:
- Josh Harmon, Team Leader
- Kali McKee
- Christoff Kenworthy

###NOTE:
For anyone perusing the code I would like to point out a few things. Namely that this was written before anyone on the team, including myself, had be taught object oriented concepts. As such it is a bit of a cludge with having a single class do most of the work. Aside from that everything works 100%. It requires Python 2.7 and Pygame to run properly. 

###Purpose:
Are you an avid fan of the old boardgame Aera and you haven't been able to find it anywhere? Pyaera is the solution you've been seeking! Pyaera is a cross platform computer version of Aera. It supports all the rules and features of Aera but with a sleek and stylish interface including cool sounds and music! So grab a friend and play!

###Features:
- Modern and stylish interface
- Fun sounds and music
- Cross platform compatability
- Fun and exciting to play
